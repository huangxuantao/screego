# Installation

Latest Version: **GITHUB_VERSION**

?> Before starting Screego you may read [Configuration](config.md).

!> TLS is required for Screego to work. Either enable TLS inside Screego or 
   use a reverse proxy to serve Screego via TLS.

## Docker

Setting up Screego with docker is pretty easy, you basically just have to start the docker container, and you are ready to go:

[ghcr.io/screego/server](https://github.com/orgs/screego/packages/container/package/server) and
[screego/server](https://hub.docker.com/r/screego/server)
docker images are multi-arch docker images.
This means the image will work for `amd64`, `i386`, `ppc64le` (power pc), `arm64`, `armv7` (Raspberry PI) and `armv6`.

When using [TURN](nat-traversal.md), Screego will allocate ports for relay
connections, this currently only works with network mode host inside docker.
See [#56](https://github.com/huangxuantao/screego/issues/56)

By default, Screego runs on port 5050.

?> Replace `EXTERNALIP` with your external IP. One way to find your external ip is with ipify.

   ```bash
   $ curl 'https://api.ipify.org'
   ```

### Network Host

```bash
$ docker run --net=host -e SCREEGO_EXTERNAL_IP=EXTERNALIP ghcr.io/screego/server:GITHUB_VERSION
```

#### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  screego:
    image: ghcr.io/screego/server:GITHUB_VERSION
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      SCREEGO_EXTERNAL_IP: "EXTERNALIP"
```
